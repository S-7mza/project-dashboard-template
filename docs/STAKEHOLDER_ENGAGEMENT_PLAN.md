Stakeholder Engagement Plan

Purpose
- Define how stakeholders will be identified, engaged, and consulted throughout the project lifecycle.

Stakeholder Identification
- List stakeholders: Sponsor, Product Owner, Business SMEs, Data Owners, Operations, Security, End Users.
- For each stakeholder include: role, influence, interest, contact, preferred communication.

Engagement Approach
- High influence / high interest: frequent demos, weekly updates, involved in decisions.
- Low influence / high interest: monthly updates and access to documentation.

Engagement Activities
- Kickoff and design workshops.
- Regular demos at key milestones (prototype, UAT, go-live).
- Ad-hoc reviews for critical decisions.

Feedback & Sign-off
- Use sprint demos and UAT sessions for formal acceptance.
- Keep Decision Log and Request approvals recorded in `templates/DECISION_LOG.md`.

Communication Ownership
- PM owns the engagement schedule and coordinates approvals with Sponsor.

Escalation and Issue Management
- Use `templates/ACTION_LOG.csv` for tracking issues; escalate unresolved items to Sponsor.

Review
- Update this plan after major milestones or if stakeholder map changes.
