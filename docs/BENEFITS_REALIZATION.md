Benefits Realization Plan

Purpose
- Define how benefits from the dashboard will be measured, tracked and reported.

Benefits
- Benefit 1: Time saved in reporting (measure: hours/month reduced; baseline: [hrs]).
- Benefit 2: Improved SLA adherence (measure: % on-time vs baseline).
- Benefit 3: Reduction in ad-hoc manual reconciliations (measure: # incidents/month).

Metrics & Targets
- Define for each benefit: metric owner, baseline, target, measurement frequency.

Tracking & Reporting
- Monthly benefits report to Sponsor summarizing metrics vs targets.
- Actions to realize benefits (e.g., user training, adoptability measures).

Owner
- PM owns benefits tracking; business sponsor owns benefit acceptance.

Review cadence
- Monthly for first 3 months after go-live, then quarterly.
