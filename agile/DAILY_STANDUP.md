Daily Standup Template

Purpose
- Sync the team, surface blockers, and coordinate day-to-day work.

When
- Every working day, same time and place (timebox: 15 minutes).

Attendees
- Development Team, Scrum Master (facilitator), optional PO attendance for quick clarifications.

Format (Keep it short)
- Each team member answers:
  1. What I did yesterday related to the sprint goal.
  2. What I plan to do today.
  3. Any blockers or impediments.

Facilitator role
- Keep the meeting on time; capture blockers in `templates/ACTION_LOG.csv` and assign owners. Defer deep problem solving to follow-up sessions.

Outputs
- Updated board or backlog status (e.g., `agile/SPRINT_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.csv`), list of blockers and owners.

Notes
- Not a status meeting for stakeholders — keep it focused on delivery and coordination.
