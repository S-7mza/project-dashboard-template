Retrospective Template

Purpose
- Inspect the sprint process and adapt: what went well, what didn't, and actionable improvements.

When
- After the Sprint Review, timebox 45–60 minutes for a 2-week sprint.

Attendees
- Development Team, Scrum Master (facilitator), Product Owner (optional).

Preparation
- Gather metrics (velocity, burndown, incidents), notes from the sprint, and any feedback collected.

Agenda
1. Set the Stage (5 minutes): facilitator explains the goal of the retrospective and safety rules.
2. Gather Data (10–15 minutes): collect facts, metrics, and examples of events during the sprint.
3. Generate Insights (15–20 minutes): discuss root causes for issues and highlight successes.
4. Decide on Actions (10–15 minutes): agree 2–3 concrete improvement actions for the next sprint. Assign owners and due dates.
5. Close (5 minutes): quick team appreciation and summary of action items.

Outputs
- 2–3 measurable improvement actions recorded in `templates/ACTION_LOG.csv` with owners and due dates.
- Retro notes saved in meeting minutes for team reference.

Techniques
- Try Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For), or Mad/Sad/Glad for variety.

Notes
- Ensure action items are realistic and owned. Review previous retro actions at the next retrospective.
